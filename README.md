Health care costs have been rising at an alarming rate in the USA. The cost of insurance premiums have been increasing, as well as the cost to the CMMS which manages the Medicare programs of millions of Americans. One way to lower the rising costs is by providing preventive services to patients who may be high risk for developing healthcare conditions/complications in the future.

The Center for Disease Control and Prevention conducts a National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey among carefully chosen Physicians in the US to understand services provided to patients in physician offices. A very small number of physicians (a few hundreds) are carefully selected to represent all the physicians in the US, including representation by region, demographics and medical specialty. As this is a complex survey, analysis of data from this survey must be done after applying survey weights as suggested by the CDC.
